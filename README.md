# killer-trash

This is an abandoned Offensive Windows project. There were a few things I thought would be interesting to the public. May cleanup code and document further at a later date.
The injector is written in Python and leverages the lief library.
The main capability (agent) is written in C++.

## Create a section in killer-trash via the injector and place an encrypted payload into it.
## Find a process location on disk if it is found running.
## Search yourself in memory and extract payload.
